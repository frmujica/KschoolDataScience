    "The main reason for working in this project is to make easier the vulnerability management. Many people thinks that it is simple as just as run a vulnerability scan and then just give a simple report to the responsible team for patching however there is nothing more wrong than that. Vulnerability management is very important activity to analyze those reports, one of those steps consist in **categorizing vulnerabilities in groups**, filter all the important one, then we have got to reduce false positives and group as much as possible the vulnerabilities that can be solved by the same patch to make the work easier for patching team. Probably, one of the most difficult job is to categorize all of those vulnerabilities, especially if you have got different tools that work and generate results in different ways.\n",

    "The scope of this project is only about categorizing vulnerabilities from [Openvas](http://www.openvas.org/) because the tool is open source and its data is open to public. this might be called the first \"subproject\" from a bigger one. Categorizing too many vulnerabilities could be an exhaustive work, especially if there come from many tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many people would think the scope of this project is quite short however we plan to go further and make this project much more elegant, in the future we want to implement this to other tools like [Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/) or [Insightvm](https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightvm/), we are also focusing only in \"plugins\" or \"knowledge database\" because we are not going to run any vulnerability scan and we do not have the resources and open data to do this, imagine that nobody who has common sense is going to public their vulnerabilities to Internet, that is going to make hackers' job easier. However our job is going to be useful because companies will be able to join their vulnerabilities results with the output we generated and they can enrich their results with the data we categorized. Also we plan to use analytics and/or other machine learning models that can suggest to patching team things like \"Close port 8900 on this servers and you will be less vulnerable to Elastic vulnerabilities\"."
